# Having the idea
So you have come up with a great indie game idea or application that will make you millions, and you have done more than the 99% and have decided to go from the **thinking** phase to the **doing** phase.

Now rather than rushing in to some implementation based on some torrent of ideas from your mind, you need to take a step back and think about the high level aspects of what you are wanting to do and how you are going to achieve them.

## What it is?
So before you go anywhere, write a brief synopsis/pitch of what your game/application is, try to describe the main mechanics, such as if your game is a platformer what makes it stand out, if it is an RPG detail the high level story arc or something so you can give this to anyone else and they will be able to understand where you are coming from with your ideas, be it team members or publishers.

> A lot of people will start an idea as a single person, and thats fine, but realistically these days it is very difficult to make an entire game as one man so it is likely that at some point you will need to bring in others to help you. Without some high level blurb about what you are trying to achieve it may be a struggle getting the new guy into the same idea space as yourself. So think about this when you are writing your summary.

This sort of approach also helps anchor you when your ideas will start running wild. It doesn't need to be long, just a few paragraphs that encapsulates your game and if you want more information there is a great article here on writing game pitches [http://www.gamedonia.com/blog/game-pitch-how-to](http://www.gamedonia.com/blog/game-pitch-how-to).
